       <p><p style="color: blue;"> Prabhas made his acting debut with the drama Eeswar (2002), and later attained his breakthrough with the action romance Varsham (2004). He went on to act in other commercially successful films such as Chatrapathi (2005), Bujjigadu (2008), Billa (2009), Darling (2010), Mr. Perfect (2011), and Mirchi (2013), winning the Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the lattermost.[12][13]

Prabhas then starred in a dual role in the blockbuster epic action duology Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) and its sequel Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), with the latter emerging as the highest-grossing Indian film of all time at that point. Prabhas became the first pan-Indian star and earned international recognition for his performance in the films.[14][15][16][17] He has since starred in the action thriller Saaho (2019), the action drama Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (2023), and the science fiction film Kalki 2898 AD (2024), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.[18][19]

Prabhas is the only Indian actor to have six films with a worldwide gross opening of over ₹100 crore. He is also the only South Indian actor with six films that have crossed the ₹100 crore nett mark in the Hindi market. Furthermore, Prabhas is the first Indian actor to have a film gross over ₹1000 crore worldwide. Additionally, he is the first South Indian actor to receive a wax sculpture at a Madame Tussaud's museum.[20] This paragraph is red.</p>
